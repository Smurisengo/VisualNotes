## VisualNotes 

### Overview

This iOS app aims to uncover the hidden potential of visual notes by providing context and reminders for your screenshots and Photos. A personal project that turned into an insightful exploration, the app leverages various technologies to bring order to the chaos of digital captures.

### Features

Retrieve Device Screenshots: Easily access all screenshots on your device.
Take Pictures: In App Camera for simple photo Reminders
Tagging: Easily apply Tags for your images
Text Scanning (OCR): Recognizes text within images for easy search.
Object Recognition: Recognizes text within images for easy search.
Location-Based Reminders: Get reminded about relevant screenshots when you're nearby.
Time-Based Contextual Reminders: Intelligent triggers for timely notifications.

### Technologies Used

Xcode: Main development environment.
Vision Framework: Used for OCR (Object Character Recognition).
CoreML and MobileNet: Experimented with object recognition. While easy to Deploy MobileNet Lacked the required accuracy. For example, a picture of a computer charger was described as a toilet seat. For the purpose of our app, this type of errors would hinder the credibility. Imagine receving a notification saying "Hey this is a toilet seat" while it's a phone charger
CoreDataManager: For storing abd fetching images, image data and Locations

### Setup and Installation

You can download the code and runit in Xcode. Beta App to be shared soon

### Design Journey

User Research: Extensive research into the common challenges faced with managing screenshots and photo notes
Prototyping: Sketches and prototypes were created to visualize the solution.
AI Exploration: An adventurous journey into AI for object recognition.
Continuous Iteration: Ongoing development focusing on the 'when', 'where', and 'why' of screenshots.
